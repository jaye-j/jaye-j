    <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p>My name is Jacob Robert Jensen, however I prefer to go by 'Jaye'. I am 21 years old and am a beginner in computer coding. I have two tattoos currently and plan to get way more in the future. 
      Since high school, I have worked in jobs as a Baker, Golf-cart Washer, Cashier/Keyholder, Linecook, and <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/021/311/free.jpg">Realtor</a>.
      In my free time I enjoy playing videogames, browsing the internet looking at memes, listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBuub4Xe1mw">classic rock</a>, watching <a href="https://pics.me.me/king-of-the-hill-is-just-texas-anime-48722336.png">King of the Hill</a> or horror movies, and playing Magic the Gathering with my cousins. 
      I have also newly became vegan which I started in the beginning of August 2019.
